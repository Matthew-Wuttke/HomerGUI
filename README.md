# HomerGUI

Took a school project that just had clip art images of a chicken, a farmer, a bag of wheat, a fox, and no sounds into a project that used gifs, background water sounds, and Homer Simpson lines from the Simpsons.

I used Microsoft Visual Studio as my editor and C# as the programming language.

I learned from this project how logic can remain in its own area and all the GUI just makes calls to the logic class.
